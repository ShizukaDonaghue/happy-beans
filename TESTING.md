## Code Validation

### HTML
All the pages were run through [W3C HTML Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for any issues and syntax errors.
Initiallly, there were some errors identified due to a missing closing tag and image height values.
Once these issues were rectified, all pages passed validation, except for errors related to Summernote and Bootstrap codes.
Please see below results for each page.

  <summary>Post and Update Recipe Pages - Errors identified for Summernote fields</summary> 
  
  
 

</details>

Errors were identified in these pages, however, they were all related to Summernote widget that is used in the recipe form for these pages.
The same errors were identified for both pages as the same form is used in both pages. 
Since all the errors were related to Summernote codes and not my own, these were not rectified. 
These errors do not affect the functionality of the application.

  <summary>Recipe Details Page - Errors identified for Bootstrap CSS property</summary>
